# Kriyabot

Creating a simple Python chatbot using natural language processing and deep learning.

This chatbot supports queries related to the Kriyadocs Online Collaboration Platform.

With Keras and Tensorflow at its backend and Python Flask for web app support, this chatbot provides the user an intuitive UI to ask his/her questions.

The chatbot predicts the answer using the pre-trained model and gives an appropriate response.

To host the cahtbot online, we have used ngrok library supported by Python.
